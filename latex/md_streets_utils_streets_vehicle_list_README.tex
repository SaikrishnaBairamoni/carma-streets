The {\ttfamily streets\+\_\+vehicle\+\_\+list\+\_\+lib} is meant to store data objects to store information about vehicles in the intersection received from {\ttfamily status\+\_\+intent\+\_\+msgs}. It also enables extensible update parsing business logic through the abstract class {\ttfamily status\+\_\+intent\+\_\+processor}, allowing for many different implementations of this business logic isolated from the data it modifies.\hypertarget{md_streets_utils_streets_vehicle_list_README_autotoc_md93}{}\doxysection{Data Objects}\label{md_streets_utils_streets_vehicle_list_README_autotoc_md93}
The {\ttfamily vehicle} struct holds all the kinematic information about vehicles and information about their state and intended path in the intersection. The {\ttfamily future\+\_\+info} struct holds kinematic information for a future point in the vehicles path The {\ttfamily vehicle\+\_\+list} contains the a map of all the currently active vehicles in the intersection. Vehicles are active as long as the timeout for updates, configured in the status\+\_\+intent\+\_\+processor, has not expired. After the timeout expires vehicles are removed from the map. This object offers thread-\/safe methods to consume json updates {\ttfamily void process\+\_\+update(const std\+::string \&update)} and access vehicle information \+: {\ttfamily std\+::vector$<$vehicle$>$ get\+\_\+vehicles\+\_\+by\+\_\+state(const vehicle\+\_\+state state)}, {\ttfamily std\+::vector$<$vehicle$>$ get\+\_\+vehicles\+\_\+by\+\_\+lane(const int lane\+\_\+id)}, and {\ttfamily std\+::unordered\+\_\+map$<$std\+::string, vehicle$>$ get\+\_\+vehicles()}.\hypertarget{md_streets_utils_streets_vehicle_list_README_autotoc_md94}{}\doxysection{Status Intent Processor}\label{md_streets_utils_streets_vehicle_list_README_autotoc_md94}
The {\ttfamily vehicle\+\_\+list} object also contains a {\ttfamily shared\+\_\+ptr$<$status\+\_\+intent\+\_\+processor$>$}. The {\ttfamily status\+\_\+intent\+\_\+processor} is a abstract class with one pure virtual method {\ttfamily void process\+\_\+update(const std\+::string \&update)}, which allows inheriting classes to implement custom status\+\_\+intent message parsing and vehicle list updating business logic. Currently the only implementation of this is the {\ttfamily all\+\_\+stop\+\_\+status\+\_\+intent\+\_\+processor} which holds logic for considering when vehicles are stopped, determining vehicle state based on kinematic information and other UC1 specific business logic. Eventually we will be able to replace this business logic for UC3 by simply replacing the {\ttfamily all\+\_\+stop\+\_\+status\+\_\+intent\+\_\+processor} with another class that inherits from `status\+\_\+intent\+\_\+process' like \textquotesingle{}signalized\+\_\+status\+\_\+intent\+\_\+processor{\ttfamily . This way we don\textquotesingle{}t need to edit the logic in the class directly and can just set the processor in the}vehicle list\`{} and rely on polymorphism.\hypertarget{md_streets_utils_streets_vehicle_list_README_autotoc_md95}{}\doxysection{Include streets\+\_\+vehicle\+\_\+list}\label{md_streets_utils_streets_vehicle_list_README_autotoc_md95}
Streets Vehicle List CMake\+List.\+txt includes an install target which will install this library as a CMake package. The library along with it\textquotesingle{}s dependencies can then be included by simply using the {\ttfamily find\+\_\+package()} instruction.
