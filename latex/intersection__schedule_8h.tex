\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Struct to store vehicle schedules for all vehicle in an intersection. Includes a timestamp in milliseconds since epoch. Also includes a get\+\_\+delay method that will get each vehicle schedules delay and sum them for a total intersection delay. Delay is the difference between scheduled Entering Time (et) and scheduled Stopping time (st) and represents the time a vehicle would be waiting at the stop bar before gaining access to the intersection. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
