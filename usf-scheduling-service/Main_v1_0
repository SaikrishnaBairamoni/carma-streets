/**
* CARMA Streets scheduling algorithm designed for stop-controlled intersections:
* 
*
* This service will continuously consume vehicle information from a designed Kafka topic, will schedule vehicles
* and estimate their critical time steps, and finally, will produce the scheduling results into another Kafka topic.
*
* This service is designed for cooperation Class D C-ADS equipped vehicles.
*
* Four different state based on the algorithm design is defined for each D C-ADS equipped vehicles:
*	- Entering Vehicle (EV): Vehicles that are approaching the intersection and cannot stop at the stop bar in the next time step
*	- Ready-to-Depart Vehicles (RDV): Vehicles that are stopped at the stop bars and are ready to enter the intersection box. 
*		Note that, if there is more than one vehicle from an entry lane stopped behind the intersection box, only the leading vehicle 
*		will be considered as RDV and the rest will be still considered as EVs. Each RDV is associated with a fixed order index in the RDV departure sequence.
*	- Departing Vehicles (DV): Vehicles that are moving within the intersection box. Note that, vehiclesï¿½ cooperation class determines whether one or more 
*		vehicles can use the intersection box simultaneously.
*	- Leaving Vehicles (LV): Vehicles that already departed the intersection box 
*
* Notes: 
*	- the consumer and producer functions must be added.
*	- the function for identifying each vehicle's lane index and the Map class information must be updated.
